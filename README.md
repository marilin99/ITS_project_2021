## Schedule for the ITS project about path planning algorithms 

* W8: get OSM working through Python, establish path planning algorithms which are going to be used 
* W9: test path planning algorithms on the map 

W10-14: user interface (in more detail soon) - PyQT5

For running the "app", the repo should be cloned, and main.py should be run, the data folder has OSM data about Tartu city.
